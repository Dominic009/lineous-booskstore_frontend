## Implementation Notes

1. **Cart Management**: Before creating an order, ensure the user has items in their cart
2. **Address Validation**: The `addressId` must belong to the authenticated user
3. **Receipt Generation**: Receipts are generated asynchronously after order creation
4. **PDF Access**: Receipt PDFs are stored on Cloudinary and accessed via URL
5. **Order History**: Use `GET /orders` to display order history in the frontend
